A Unity turn-based card game made for a school project over the course of 3> months in a project team of 4. 

I was the writer and UI/UX designer for the project. I also handled part of the gameplay logic and helped debug/fix all aspects of the game when necessary (and other teammembers were unavailable), meaning I had to understand and resolve code that I never touched with a working knowledge of Unity.
